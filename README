aws-twitter is a simple emr-based project to analyze the twitter graph.
The data is from:
	http://an.kaist.ac.kr/traces/WWW2010.html
and includes:
  - 41.7 million user profiles, 
  - 1.47 billion social relations (edges)

S3 location for this dataset is:
  s3://data.karanb.amazon.com/social/twitter.net


TO USE:
------

Step 0: edit the Makefile to reflect your environement.

	set the path to your emr commandline executable, and your s3cmd,
	and set the other variables as appropriate

Step 1: create the cluster

	% make create

	this will create a jobflow and put the jobflowid in ./jobflowid
	if all goes well.  

Step 2: push jars and scripts to s3 bucket

	% make bootstrap

	this will create a new bucket on s3 and push the jar files in lib/
	and the scripts in hive/ and pig/ to the new bucket.

Step 3: submit a job

	% make submithivejob

	% make submitpigjob

	% make submitjarjob

	Each will submit a new job to the hadoop cluster


Step 4: look for output

	% make logs

	will show the stdout/stderr of the current job.  


Of course, feel free to edit the Makefile to better suite your needs.
